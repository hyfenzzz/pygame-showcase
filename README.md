<h1> IMPORTANT THINGS </h1>
Forgive me for not having an actual executable file for this, but I currently do not have the time to deal with errors regarding pyinstaller. 
That being said, I have provided the source code of the game (main.py) as well as a folder of all the assets used, so you can try to build the project on your own with your own text editor/IDE. 


If you are attempting to build this on your own, make sure to extract the DATA.zip file and then extract ALL image files from inside the file, then place them in the EXACT SAME directory as the main.py file. This is very important, if the image files are not in the same directory as the main.py file the game will crash as a result of not having the assets that it's supposed to.
