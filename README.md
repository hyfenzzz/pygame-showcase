<h1> IMPORTANT THINGS </h1>
As this is only a pygame demo, on top of errors regarding PyInstaller, I have not yet made an actual executable file for this game
That being said, I have provided the source code of the game (main.py) as well as a folder of all the assets used, so you can try to build the project on your own with your own text editor/IDE


If you are attempting to build this on your own, make sure to extract the DATA.zip file and then extract ALL image files from inside the file, then place them in the EXACT SAME directory as the main.py file.
